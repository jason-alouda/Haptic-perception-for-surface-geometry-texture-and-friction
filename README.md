Abstract:

Haptic exploration of the physical world takes place through several interrogation methods like tapping, scratching, pressing. This paper focuses on the “stroking” technique and makes use of the vibrational and kinesthetic cues obtained while stroking to get as much information from a surface as possible. For example, if you close your eyes and touch an unknown surface, one of the primary ways to identify it is by stroking it, and see how rough or smooth or coarse or grainy it is (texture), whether it flat or wavy or has another pattern (geometry), as well as how slippery it is (friction). 

Our work differs from most research done previously by focusing on the intersection of friction, texture and geometry, rather than treating those properties separately. Indeed, the overlap between them is non-negligible and drawing those boundaries can be confusing and seem to be arbitrary. Hence, we made a model that can, within one stroke, discriminate between each of those three surface features, and then identify them separately.
